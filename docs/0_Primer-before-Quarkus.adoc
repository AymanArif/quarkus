== Monolith vs Microservice


=== Monolith

=== Microservice


=== Pros and Cons


== Reactive

=== Reactive Manifesto

=== Reactive Systems

=== Reactive Streams


== Microprofile

=== Eclipse 

=== SmallRye


=== Microprofile Specifications

==== CDI

==== JAX-RS
==== JSON-B
==== JSON-P

==== Configuration
==== Eclipse Microprofile Fault Tolerance
==== Eclipse Microprofile Health API
==== Eclipse Microprofile Metrics
==== Eclipse Microprofile OpenAPI
==== Eclipse Microprofile REST Client
==== Eclipse Microprofile JWT Auth

==== Eclipse Microprofile OpenTracing

WARNING: This API has been deprecated in MicroProfile 3.3 and will be replaced by OpenTelemetry (OpenCensus + OpenTracing) in a future release.

=== Standalone Releases

*Specs which are being incubated or in progress. Note that these can be integrated into Microprofile or may get obsolete*

==== Context Propogation

==== Reactive Messaging

Alows you to run *Kafka, AMQP or MQTT*

==== Mutiny

Reactive Programming Library

== Cloud Native


=== Docker

Remember Docker is already confused with containerd in the Kubernetes space.

Check vailable exensions with `mvn quarkus:list-extensions`

- https://github.com/agroal/agroal[Agroal] is the datasource connection pool implementation in Quarkus that integrates with transactions, security and other systems. Quarkus team chose Agroal and not the popular *Hikari Pool*

- Hibernate ORM is the ORM framework implementingJava Persistence API. (Reactive Hibernate has just started OSS[December-2020])

- Hibernate Validator is the OSS reference implementation of Bean Validation. (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380[JSR-380])

- https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana[Narayana] is the premier OSS transaction manager with over 30 years of expertise in the area of transaction processing.
- https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny[SmallRye Mutiny] is the reactive programming library. 
- Vert.x is an event-driven and non-blocking tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM.


When it comes to implementing MicroProfile, Quarkus uses several implementations that come either from Jakarta EE or SmallRye. The MicroProfile implementations used by Quarkus are the following ones:

- ArC is the Context and Dependency Injection implementation
- RESTEasy is the Java API for RESTful Web Services implementation
- Yasson is the JSON Binding implementation
- Glassfish JSON-P is the JSON Processing implementation
- RestEasy Client Microprofile is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile REST Client
- SmallRye Config is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Configuration
- SmallRye Fault Tolerance is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
-  SmallRye Health is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Health
- SmallRye JWT is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile JWT Auth
- SmallRye Metrics is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics
- SmallRye OpenAPI is the implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI
